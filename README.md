# Overview
This is the code to perform Coble creep deformation and void nucleation/growth simulation in a 3D polycrystalline solid.

# Requirements
* [Neper](https://neper.info/index.html) to generate initial grain distribution
  * Runs on Unix-like system (including Windows Subsystem for Linux)
  * [Installation guide](https://neper.info/doc/introduction.html#installing-neper) is available
* [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run the simulation.
